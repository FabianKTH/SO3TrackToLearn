# TrackToLearn Fork - Spherical Equivariant Agents

This repository is a fork of the [TrackToLearn framework](https://github.com/scil-vital/TrackToLearn), forked at commit [968b28ff300055d4fccc8e024d705310a74b7aee](https://github.com/scil-vital/TrackToLearn/commit/968b28ff300055d4fccc8e024d705310a74b7aee). We highly recommend getting familiar with the original TrackToLearn framework before exploring this adaptation for spherical equivariant models.

This repository accompanies our pre-print **"Leveraging Rotational Equivariance for Reinforcement Learning in Tractography"**. (Pre-print link: TODO)

## Requirements
To run this version, ensure you have the SE(3) transformer implementation by NVIDIA available in your `PYTHONPATH`:
- [NVIDIA SE(3) Transformer](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/DGLPyTorch/DrugDiscovery/SE3Transformer)
